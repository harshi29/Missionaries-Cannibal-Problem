# Missionaries-Cannibals-Problem


# Problem Description
In the missionaries and cannibals problem, three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, if there are missionaries present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals (if they were, the cannibals would eat the missionaries). The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. (Taken from Wikipedia) 

# Implementation
Implements the various search strategies (mentioned below) available in the aima code to solve the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem.
1. Uniform Cost-Search

2. Iterative Deepening Search

3. Greedy Best First Search

4. A* Search 

5. Recursive Best-First Search

# How to run the code 
Run the code on the terminal by giving the arguments: 
Example - 
3 for number of Missionaries
3 for number of Cannibals
